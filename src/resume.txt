	reference = I have known Arjun for a long time now, both professionally and personally. Arjun was one of the best grad developers I have worked with - he was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and a pleasure to work with. During his time at IFPI he was keen to learn new technologies and was able to deliver on some solid solutions which are still in use. Arjun also has a thorough understanding of fundamentals of computer science and was also very creative in his programming. I look forward to working again with Arjun in the near future.
