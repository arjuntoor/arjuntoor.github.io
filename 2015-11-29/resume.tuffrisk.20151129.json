It has saved the MoD some $1.2bn in costs from the start of the project and is worth over $5.5bn over its lifetime. I am responsible for developing the live call center systems handling ordering, asset tracking, billing and fault reporting. With the system processing roughly $460m of costs per year, and automation counting for around 35% of all orders, my role within the development team focuses on the design and development of new innovative functionality, with a strong focus on time and cost saving through further automation. My success in the role has been largely due to my innovative and analytical approach to problem solving, and introducing effective new processes across teams.",

        "Was heavily involved in a contract project to develop a new set of systems around reporting and statistics. Had exposure to an array of new technologies, for example the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack and dimensional data modeling. As an integral part of the agile-managed project team I gained an understanding of the management style from both technical and non-technical perspectives.",
